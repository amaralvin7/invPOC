Explanations of how prior estimates were obtained

Lp
- Original MODIS file name: g4.timeAvgMap.MODISA_L3m_KD_8d_4km_2018_Kd_490.20180926-20181122.157W_19S_148W_55N.nc
- 8-day averages with 4km resolution were averaged over the sampling timeline (20180926-20181122)
- reciprocal of nearest Kd was chosen

Po
- From Kenyon's readme: NPP was estimated using the MODIS r2018 satellite product and the carbon-based productivity model (CbPM \cite{westberry2008}) by Oregon State University Ocean Productivity. Average NPP for 16 days prior to each sampling date was determined using a weighted average of 8-day NPP products within an 18 km by 18 km region containing each station.
- I match each station sampling date with the nearest previous satellite sampling date (satellite sampling dates are the beginning of the 8-day averages) to get estimates of integrated NPP at each station
- I divide the integrated NPP at a given station by its Lp prior to obtain Po

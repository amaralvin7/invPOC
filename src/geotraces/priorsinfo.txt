Explanations of how prior estimates were obtained

Lp
- 8-day averages with 4km resolution were obtained over the sampling timeline from Modis Aqua (4km)
- For each station, the sampling time was selected from the shallow cast, and was matched with the 8-day satellite average that contained this sampling time
- Kd was selected from the nearest location where there was an estimate
- reciprocal of nearest Kd was calculated

Po
- 2160 by 4320 (9km resolution) 8day HDF files from MODIS r2018 (GSM) Data were obtained from Oregon State Ocean Productivity for the 8-day windows that spanned the cruise. These are NPP estimates in mg m-2 d-1
- For each station, the sampling time was selected from the shallow cast, and was matched with the 8-day satellite average that contained this sampling time
- NPP was selected from the nearest location where there was an estimate
- I convert the integrated NPP to mmol, then divde by Lp*0.99 (see code)

POC Data (see notebook notes from 2/25/2022)
- GT13613 was a failed DCM measurement and should be deleted from all POC data spreadsheets. This allows GT13696 (its redo) to be interpolated from GT13612/4, since it has QF=4.
- Stn. 37 is missing LSF at 450 (GT15516), so it should be interpolated from a deeper depth. To this end, value was changed to 0 and QF to 4 (both from NaN).

ODF data
- Deleted row for GT13613, and copied CorrectedMeanDepthm from GP15merge
